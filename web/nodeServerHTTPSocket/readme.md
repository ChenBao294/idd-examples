Minimal example of updating a web page live through socket.io with data received through a HTTP GET request to a server.

* Install node and npm
* Install dependencies with "npm install".
* Run with "npm start" (to get access to port 80 on OS X, this may be "sudo npm start").
* Open http://localhost in your browser - this corresponds to public/index.html
* To update data on this page, open http://localhost/update?value=x with some value for x.
